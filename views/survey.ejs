						The last customer meeting for your project was a disaster. Communication has
						been limited for the last month and the customer is expecting a full report
						from today’s meeting. As you leave your office for the meeting, you overhear
						the administrative assistant saying,
						<br>
						<blockquote>
							“If Joe calls in, please see that he calls home. His spouse says there is a
							mini-crisis.”
						</blockquote>
						<br>
						You are to meet with Joe at the customer’s office, and the two of you are to lead
						the meeting. Joe’s participation is critical. Joe is quite nervous and often gives
						a bad impression if distracted. What do you do?

						You and your friend work at two competing companies. Two days before the

						first met, you helped him a lot with his code and he wants to repay the favor.
						You were required to sign a Non-Disclosure-Agreement for this job, and you know
						your company isn’t willing to hire consultants at this time (especially ones
						from their top competitor). What do you do?

						You and your coworkers have been working for the last year on an update to

						one coworker suggests configuring the initial release to send an error report
						of everything being done by the user whenever a system breakdown occurs. This
						data collection would keep track of all recent events, running apps and current
						texts. Data collection for the sake of improving the software is
						allowed in the company’s privacy policy. What do you do?
